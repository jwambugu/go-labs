This repository contains challenges and projects I tackle using golang.

- [Web crawler](https://github.com/jwambugu/go-labs/tree/main/internal/crawler)
    - Implements a recursive, mirroring web crawler . The crawler should be a command-line tool that accepts a starting
      URL and a destination directory. The crawler will then download the page at the URL, save it in the destination
      directory, and then recursively proceed to any valid links in this page.

- [Queue](https://github.com/jwambugu/go-labs/tree/main/internal/queue)
    - Implement a queue. The queue should be able to queue future jobs. Use any implementation as you please.
