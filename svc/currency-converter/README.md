# Currency Convertor
Implement a simple web service that converts currencies in Go. This web service should only convert these currencies
Nigerian Naira(NGN), Ghanaian Cedis(GHS), and Kenyan Shillings (KSH) from anyone to any other. This web service should
not depend on any external API for currency rates. A local conversion table should be used. Use the least number of
dependencies as much as possible and any dependency used should be justifiable.
